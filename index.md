**This website introduce who I am as a person and as a programmer.**

## Introduction
Hi everyone, my name is Jialu Sui, and I am a third year student major in Math-Cs and Cognitive Science in Marshall College. I like shopping, drinking coffee, listening to music and playing some mobile games in my free time, and my favorite programming language is python.

## My understanding of programming and programmer
The best idea I've ever seen in internet about programmers is 
> "The code works" isn’t where you stop; it’s where you start
I always believe that the most important thing about programming is not making the code work, is understanding what we are doing and thinking about how could we do better.

For example, we could create a random integer from 1 to 100 by simply writing the code `random.randint(1,100)`. But as a programmer, we have the responsibility to understand the logic behind this line of code everytime we use it.

## My favorite website
One website that I really enjoy reading is [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). It covers great material over many topics that I am interested in, such as Reinforcement learning and Natural Language Processing.

## My favorite Movies
My favorite movies are:
- Alice in Wonderland
- After
- One Day

My personal rankings are:
1. After
2. Alice in Wonderland
3. One Day

Tasks I wish to accomplish this year:
- [ ] Find a summer intern
- [ ] Receive offers to my favorite master programs
- [ ] Come back to campus soon
